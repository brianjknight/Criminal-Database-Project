# JavaForce5 Reflection


## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 
  * I was able to follow my design document relatively close to the original. The biggest change was incorporating optional query parameters for the criminalrecords/filter/{state} endpoint. When I first built the method in the API Gateway, query parameters were not included.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  * I found brainstorming and using project ideation to be helpful.
  * Basing user stories on implementing CRUD operations for a database was a good starting point.
  * From there I could decide how to incorporate more complex strategies.

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
  * Being the first time we created  a project from sctracth rather than starter code, I found it overwhelming at times.
  * Breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable tasks was very helpful. Using cards on Trello is a great tool for this.
  * On specific problems for tasks, I searched resources like StackOverflow, W3Schools, and AWS documentation for examples and syntax explanations. 
  <br><br>
  
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  * I made a mock team charter but did the project solo. This charter did not apply for resolving issues on this project.


## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
  * There were limited peers at this point in the program who were working at different paces due to the self-paced version. So I did not have scrums but tried to rely on my Trello workspace assigning cards to weekly tasks and tasks in progress to stay on track. I found Trello to be very helpful to organize tasks.
  <br><br>
  
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  * Yes. I underestimated the work needed to complete this project. The biggest set backs were learning new technologies or more in depth understanding of technologies we have been given basic information on.
  * Learning to read documentation will be a critical skill this career. 
  * Finding the correct documentation slowed me down. Refining searches with correct keywords and phrasing can save a lot of time by not reading irrelevant documents and details.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
  * I would spend more time on the design document and initial planning. Refactoring code is time-consuming and error prone.
  * Now that I have a better understanding of DynamoDB tables and API endpoints, I would spend more time considering table design and maybe structure the data differently.
