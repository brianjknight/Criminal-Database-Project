# JavaForce5 Team Charter

## Purpose

As we learned from the reading, highly performing teams have the following
qualities:

* Psychological safety
* Dependability
* Structure and clarity
* Meaning
* Impact

Your team’s charter captures the ways in which your team will commit to
providing and cultivating these qualities. Provide the information requested in
this charter, but feel free to modify the formatting to best suit your team’s
needs and style.

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**  
    Try to be open and honest. Be proactive in asking others peoples opinions rather than waiting 
    them to speak up on their own. Give suggestions and constructive criticism rather than passing judgements.   


* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  
  Address negativity, disagreements, and arguments that may arise during meetings 
  or communications. If you notice any derogatory, harmful, or unsafe language, 
  speak with others to see if they feel unsafe or intimidated. Convey your concerns to the team
  in a mindful manner. If issues persist speak with your Learner Coach or Instructor.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
    Estimate task work and set deadlines. Break up tasks evenly across the team based on workload.
    Encourage questions and communication if someone gets stuck on a problem so the project can
    continue to move forward.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
    Look into why a deadline was missed. Were tasks divided evenly? Were there unanticipated
    changes that caused more work or issues?

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
    Keep a documented structure for clarity. Assign goals and timelines. Keep the design document
    up to date with any changes.  Track progress in the rubric document.

### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
    Incorporate what we have learned so far in past Units and learn a new technology. 


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
    What will be true when you have 'succeeded' on this project? E.g. enjoy
    ourselves, maintain our energy to the end, ensure all team members
    participate, create professional connections, exceed instructor
    expectations, efficiently pace the project so we’re not rushing at the end,
    etc.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
    Working with HTML, CSS, and JS to become more familiar with the front end.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
    Hold daily meetings to stay track progress, address problem areas, and check in
    with well-being.
